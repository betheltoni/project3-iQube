        <p>Kanye - who recently changed his name to Ye - spoke during the recently released second part of his ‘Drink Champs’ podcast appearance, where he said he was trying to “save” his family by speaking about his ongoing divorce proceedings.<br>
          He said: “At the end of the day, I ain't got the paperwork yet. So I'm going to come on this joint and try to save my family and keep my family together."<br>
          The ‘Heartless’ rapper’s comments come after the first part of the podcast saw him state he wants to stay with Kim, and claimed their children – North, eight, Saint, five, Chicago, three, and Psalm, two – “want their parents to stay
          together”.<br>
          He explained at the time: "I ain't never even seen the papers, we're not even divorced ... That ain't no joke to me. My kids want their parents to stay together. I want us to be together."</p>

        <p>With warrior-poet intensity, Los Angeles singer/songwriter Mereba opens her AZEB EP with the defiant track “Aye.” On it, the sharp-tongued rapper hypes herself up against the war that is everyday life — but even at her most volatile,
          Mereba carefully draws her strength from her resilience rather than itchy combativeness. “I’m tryna master peace,” she rhythmically speaks, “There are buds on my fingertips growing beautiful things / There are thieves on my pillow plucking
          my peace while I sleep.” Mereba chooses the high road, chooses to find power in herself rather than using her struggles as an excuse to lord it over others. <br> AZEB, titled after Mereba’s middle name which means where the Sun rises, is
          all about creating a space of lightness for the dark moments of life.<br>
          On “Rider,” Mereba makes the case that the greatest salve for the soul is love, airing out her lofty vocals against a lush backdrop of jovial beats and instrumentation. The us-against-the-world sentiments are continued on the clapped-beats
          and winding lyricism of “Beretta”; while on “My Moon” Mereba’s ghostly cries help pen a solemn love letter of such tender passion.</p>

        <p>Due to the enormous rush at the Astroworld event and the tragedy that ensued, Drake has allegedly postponed the release of his collaborative song with French Montana titled Splash Brothers. On Friday, Drake will release his latest album,
          They Got Amnesia, which includes the upcoming single.<br>
